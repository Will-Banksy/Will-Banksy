### Hi, I'm Will

I'm a soon-to-graduate BSc Ethical Hacking student at Abertay Uni, interested in all kinds of things. I have many open-source personal projects I work on

Favourite programming language is Rust ðŸ¦€ but worked with and want to learn many more. I've done projects in many languages, notably searchlight in Rust, HoneyScoop in C#, tower initially in LLVM IR, some classical cryptography tools and pixel art editor in Java, and I've written a lot of C++, often using Qt for gui, such as in QPix (rewrite of my java pixel editor in C++)

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on QPix (and any other projects I feel like)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Qt again
- âš¡ Fun fact: Rust is memory safe
