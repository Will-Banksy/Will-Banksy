### Hi, I'm Will

I'm a soon-to-graduate BSc Ethical Hacking student at Abertay Uni, interested in all kinds of things. I have many open-source personal projects I work on

Favourite programming language is Rust ðŸ¦€ but I've worked with and want to learn many more. I've done projects in many languages, e.g. C#, LLVM IR, Java, Kotlin, C/C++, PHP, Python, etc., but I'm particularly strong in Rust & C/C++.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on QPix (and any other projects I feel like)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Qt again
- âš¡ Fun fact: Rust is memory safe

Some projects I've done/am doing:
