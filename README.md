### Hi, I'm Will

I'm a graduate BSc (Hons) Ethical Hacker, interested in all kinds of things, like compilers & programming language design, file carving, embdedded dev, website & GUI dev, reverse engineering, etc. I have many open-source personal projects I work on in my free time

Favourite programming language is Rust 🦀 but I've used and want to learn many more. I've done projects in many languages, e.g. C#, LLVM IR, x86 ASM, Java, Kotlin, C/C++, PHP, Python, etc.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on various projects interchangeably
- 🌱 I’m currently learning systems engineering at my job
- ⚡ Fun fact: Rust is memory safe

Some projects I've done/am doing:
