### Hi, I'm Will

I'm a BSc Ethical Hacking student at Abertay Uni, interested in all kinds of things. I have many open-source projects I work on

Favourite programming language is Rust ðŸ¦€ but worked with and want to learn many more. I've done projects in many languages, notably HoneyScoop in C#, tower initially in LLVM IR, some classical cryptography tools in Java, and I've written a lot of C++, often using Qt for gui

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my programming language tower and D&D tool druid_5e_manager, in the free time around studies
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about digital forensics and IoT
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: Rust is memory safe
